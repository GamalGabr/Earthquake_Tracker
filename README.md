# Earthquake_Tracker
Discover the most recent earthquakes 

I designed an R shiny app to track the latest earthquakes globally. The app is designed to be viewed on a desktop/laptop, it allows users to check the earthquakes that have occurred over the last seven days. The app provides real-time or more accurately near real-time information regarding the latest earthquakes across the globe; I have scheduled the app to check for updates from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) database every three minutes. If you would like to view the app, please visit this page : https://isaacgamal.shinyapps.io/earthqu/  . The code script I have included is somewhat chaotic at present - it is currently a single file shiny app. It includes a mixture of modules and non-modular coding. I intend to differentiate the various modules into separate files at some stage in the near future.
